# Zalando Workshop

This is the base for the workshop. The objective of this workshop is to compare state management with redux-sagas versus the new Context API.

Each project has multiple steps that can be found in the following branches:

Provider:
* p1: Implement the _Provider_ for the Cart
* p2: Implement the _Consumers_ and wire the UI
* p3: Implementation example

Redux-Sagas:
* rs1
* rs2
* rs3

## Project structure
* Components
* App
